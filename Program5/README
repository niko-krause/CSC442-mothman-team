INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM 5 - Chandler Dees 

Based on the examples provided, this program takes in standard input via redirection meaning you must 
have a text file containing your desired epoch date to run the program. 

RUNNING PROGRAM:

Command to run program5 in powershell: 

Get-Content .\epoch2.txt | .\timelock.exe

In linux it should be as simple as: 

epoch.txt > ./timelock 

This program could only be tested in powershell due to discrepancies between go versions causing 
issues on my VM 

DEBUG CONSTANT: 

To see more information in the file there is a constant boolean at the top labeled as DEBUG. 
Setting DEBUG to true will give you lots of information about every stage of the implemented 
timelock algorithm. DEBUG was set to false when submitted so that outputs match the given 
example output. 

SUBMISSION CONTENTS:

In the submitted zip there is the timelock.go file, a built executable which was built in 
powershell, two epoch files with different values for testing, and the go mod file.
